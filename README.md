## ðŸš€ Project description

**Motivation**

This is my website was created so I can show myself and my skills to the world. It represents me in the digital world. Here you can get me to know, what are my hobbies and what I'm trying to achieve. Also, there is a collection of my projects, right now more oriented to "lab" where I'm trying to build some real-world scenario apps. Enjoy!.

**Technology used**

The website was created with a typescript gatsby template with the help of the styled-components, storybook and a few npm packages. It is hosted on Netlify with a custom domain. Tests are covered with the React Testing Library & Cypress

**Content**

On this website, you can find a few static pages like the homepage, about me, work or contact page. You read information about me, what technology stack I'm using and trying to learn. See some cool 3d models which represent my hobbies and finally projects that I'm making right now. Also a bunch of links for my social media.
